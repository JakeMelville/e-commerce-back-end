# E-Commerce Back End Application

## Description 
This application is designed to act as the back end for an e-commerce website. As you can see in the video link below, we have the options to add, delete or update any product, category, or tag. The application is started by running the server in the integrated terminal. Once the server is running, we will use Insomnia to check out the get, put, post, and delete requests. 

## Technology Used 
This application was built using a configured working Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. 

## Future Innovation
Down the line I would love to design an actual website to go with this application. This would serve as a great starting point in creating an e-commerce website.
